	  <h2>CORONAVIRUS PANDAMIC</h2><br>
	  <p>The overlapping impacts of the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong>, accelerating climate disasters, and geopolitical conflict are a threat to gender equality and women’s rights across the globe. This report from UN Women and UNDP shows what governments can do now to prevent further rollbacks and recover lost ground, while enhancing resilience and preparedness for future shocks.<br>

Drawing on a unique global dataset of close to <mark>5,000 measures adopted by 226 countries and territories in response to COVID-19</mark>, the report finds that, overall, government responses paid insufficient attention to gender dynamics. At the same time, instances of innovation and learning hold important lessons for gender-responsive policymaking in times of crisis.<br>

For the first time, the report provides analysis on the factors that led to a strong gender response, generating key lessons for governments:<br>

<li>In a context of growing threats to democratic and open societies, strong institutions proved critical for an inclusive gender response.
Feminist movements and women’s rights organizations provided an early warning system on the <b>gender impacts of the pandemic,</b> particularly on violence against women and girls.</li><br>
<li><em>Women’s representation and leadership in executive positions</em>, parliaments, and public administration was critical for translating feminist advocacy into policy action.</li><br>
<li>Countries with robust public services and gender-responsive social protection systems were in a better position to respond, while others had to improvise, under pressure, and with varying degrees of success.</li><br>
<li><i>Digital tools</i> sustained feminist activism online and enabled policy innovations and rapid support roll-out, reaching groups of women often left behind in “normal times”.</li><br>
<li>Real-time gender data on the impact of the pandemic on women and girls was critical to making the case for gender-sensitive response measures, as was tracking what worked in government responses.</li><br>

	 <h2>PATHFINDER RESPONSES TO COVID-19</h2><br>
	                                     <mark> Building community and health system resilience during a crisis</mark><br>
<li>As COVID-19 rages on, Pathfinder is working with governments in 20+ countries to forge stronger health and social systems that maintain essential sexual and reproductive health services, keep our staff safe, and <b>prevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19.</b></li><br> 

<li>The heart of our challenge since the onset of the pandemic has been to continue our critical sexual and reproductive health work in an era when <strong>COVID-19</strong> has complicated nearly every decision. Lockdowns, supply shortages, and at times, a fear of going to health facilities due to COVID-19 have challenged the continued provision of sexual and reproductive health care.</li><br> 

<li>But our staff, and the communities they work <i>alongside</i>, are more than up to the challenge. Pathfinder’s targeted response is helping women, girls, and their communities not only survive this crisis but come through it stronger and more resilient.</li><br>

	 <p>How has the new coronavirus spread across the world so fast?<br>
Viruses have varying abilities to infect people. For COVID-19, each person with the virus can go on to infect around 2.5 people. If each of those people go about their day as normal, <mark>and infect another 2.5 people, within a month, 406 people would be infected just from that first infection.</mark><br>

<li>COVID-19 is more infectious than other coronaviruses such as <strong>SARS or MERS-CoV. The “case fatality rate”</strong> (CFR), or risk of dying from the new coronavirus, is about 4.4%, (although this risk varies by geography, and also can change over the course of a pandemic) is also less deadly than SARS (10%) or MERS-CoV (34%). So, if COVID-19 is less deadly than previous epidemic threats, why has it spread so far and wide that it has brought the world to a standstill?</li><br>

<li>The answer seems to be precisely because the new coronavirus is less deadly – thousands of people with either no symptoms or very mild <b>symptoms have been spreading the virus</b> unaware that they were even infected. This means that before health experts were aware of the problem and started to recommend control measures, the virus had already spread to multiple countries.</li></p><br>
